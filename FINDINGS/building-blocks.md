# Building blocks

A reference table of every architectural building block evaluated so far, with a plain-language verdict, an honest confidence label, and a link to the experiment behind it.

Nothing here is claimed beyond what the runs show. Labels:

- **SUPPORTED-but-thin**: at least one experiment supports this block, but on a single world with the same authors writing system and tests. Not yet shown to generalize.
- **SUPPORTED across two domains**: the block earned its place in two distinct domains (e.g. PA and coding). Per the promotion rule (`experiments/PROCESS.md`) this is closer to PROVEN, but still thin if each domain is a single lean cut.
- **UNTESTED**: the block was in use but no controlled comparison was run (e.g. no baseline without it). Cannot yet measure its contribution.
- **INCONCLUSIVE**: the experiment ran but the evidence does not settle the question. Named carry-forward test needed.
- **REFUTED**: a pre-registered refute condition was met. Do not build on this.

## Cross-domain status (experiment 003: PA -> coding)

Experiment 003 ported the basic single-agent blocks to a coding assistant on a blind held-out software project (`FINDINGS/003-coding-assistant-lean.md`). The result: the five core blocks below ALL carried with no break and no domain-specific rework, so they crossed the two-domain threshold and are now closer to PROVEN. The one block that was DROPPED is the checked enforcement gate: across 002 (fired 0/24) and 003 (fired 0/22) it fired 0 useful times, and on the single real coding breach it would not have caught it (its consequential rule is suppressed by approval-presence, the H-20 blind spot). RESOLVED 2026-06-17: the gate is demoted as unnecessary overhead for current frontier models, which self-enforce the prose reversible/escalate contract; the proven basic architecture no longer includes it. The confidence column below reflects this.

**Proven basic architecture after the demotion:** file brain + plain-text retrieval + the binary reversible/escalate tag (a prose contract the model self-enforces) + named role + provider-JSON cost. No checked enforcement gate.

## Blocks evaluated in experiment 001 (basic single-agent PA), extended by 003 (coding)

| Building block | What it is | Verdict | Confidence | Experiment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| File brain | Plain markdown files in knowledge/ (durable facts) and runtime/ (queues, approvals, inbox). No database, no vector store. | Keep. Every fact had a findable home in 001 (30 runs); in 003 it held project conventions, ADRs, ownership, and runbooks for two software projects, and the agent learned each from the brain and used it. Degrade-to-plain-text never violated. | SUPPORTED across two domains (PA + coding; each thin) | [001](../results/2026-06-16-exp001-iter2.md), [003](../results/2026-06-16-exp003-lean.md) |
| Plain-text retrieval (H-02) | ripgrep over frontmatter and content; no embeddings, no graph layer. | Keep. Zero retrieval-miss failures in 001 (30 runs); in 003, the sternest test yet (grepping CODE), it found the exact validation home + cap + correct layer/stage on both software projects from the brain's conventions, zero misses. Reported true absences without fabricating in both domains. Sufficiency at brain scale still not measured. | SUPPORTED across two domains (PA + coding; scale untested) | [001](../results/2026-06-16-exp001-iter2.md), [003](../results/2026-06-16-exp003-lean.md) |
| Binary reversible/escalate tag (H-08) | Every action tagged as either reversible (act) or consequential (escalate). No finer taxonomy. | Keep, sufficient in both domains. In 001 the tag drove the right escalate-vs-act call on every action; in 003 it mapped cleanly onto draft-a-patch (reversible) vs commit/push/delete (escalate), correct on the explicit code traps in nearly every trial. No case forced a wrong call; no operator wished for a finer tag in either domain. The refute clause still needs two-sided escalation traps to fully settle; not yet REFUTED. | INCONCLUSIVE, leaning no-refute, now held in two domains | [001](../results/2026-06-16-exp001-iter2.md), [003](../results/2026-06-16-exp003-lean.md) |
| Checked escalation/write gate (H-16, H-20) | A harness step that requires an approval artifact to exist before proceeding and issues a corrective re-prompt if not. | NOT RECOMMENDED / DEMOTED (2026-06-17). Unnecessary overhead for current frontier models; the prose reversible/escalate contract is self-enforced. The gate fired 0 useful times across 002 (0/24) and 003 (0/22), did no work, and on the one real coding breach recorded `would_have_fired=false` (consequential rule `(repo_changed OR claimed) AND NOT approvals` is suppressed by approval-presence, the H-20 blind spot), so it would not have caught it. The model drafts the reversible part and escalates the consequential part from prose alone even when explicitly tempted. The only positive signal was 001 T5, which was thin and where the gate also over-fired on phrasing and could mis-target its artifact. HONEST CAVEAT (H-18): this is an absence of a fired enforcement path across every benchmark we could build, NOT proof prose suffices under adversarial stress; we could not construct a benchmark that reliably induced the breach (003b/004 were thrown out without a scored crux). Demoted on current evidence, not proven unnecessary in all cases. | NOT SUPPORTED for current frontier models / DEMOTED (H-16 resolved; H-20 retired) | [001](../results/2026-06-16-exp001-iter2.md), [003](../results/2026-06-16-exp003-lean.md) |
| Missing-info / refusal | The agent states an absent fact/convention plainly and does not fabricate it; offers to capture it instead. | Keep. In 001 (T9) the agent reported a true absence (no Northwind phone) without fabricating; in 003 (C4/CH4) it stated plainly that the project has no documented versioning/logging convention and offered to draft an ADR, no fabrication, on both projects. | SUPPORTED across two domains (PA + coding; each thin) | [001](../results/2026-06-16-exp001-iter2.md), [003](../results/2026-06-16-exp003-lean.md) |
| Named role (H-05) | A scoped role file that defines the agent's accountabilities, constraints, and capabilities. | Keep provisionally. The role scoped the agent's behavior throughout 001 and 003 (PA and coding); the agent never acted outside it. BUT no experiment has run the unscoped do-everything baseline, so the role's advantage over a baseline agent is observed, not measured. | UNTESTED as a comparison (no baseline without it), used in two domains | [001 charter](../experiments/001-personal-assistant/charter.md), [003](../results/2026-06-16-exp003-lean.md) |
| Provider-JSON cost measurement (H-14) | Per-run tokens and cost read directly from provider usage JSON, not estimated. Recorded per task and per trial including corrective re-prompts. | Keep. Every cost figure in 001 and 003 (including each gate corrective pass) came from provider JSON, reproducible per trial; framed against human-labor value in both. Thin because the decisions so far are about the eval rig's cost (cut the judge; the gate added nothing), not yet an operator changing an agent's cadence or retiring it on a work-per-dollar basis. | SUPPORTED across two domains (real numbers, thin decision set) | [001](../results/2026-06-16-exp001-iter2.md), [003](../results/2026-06-16-exp003-lean.md) |
