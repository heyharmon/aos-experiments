## Question: standardize the experiment process into a reusable workflow now?

Answered as Elon would, not to please:

**No. That is premature automation.** We have run exactly one experiment, on one world, with one agent. Standardizing a process you have done once codifies assumptions from a sample of one, and you will throw most of it away after experiment 002 shows you what was actually 001-specific versus what is invariant. Automate is step 5 of the algorithm for a reason: it comes after the process is simplified and proven, and "proven" means repeated. Wrapping a workflow around a single run is polishing a step you might delete.

What we already have is enough structure: the rig (`bin/brain`, `run-task.sh`, `score.py`, `seed/`, the harness) and the experiment-folder shape (brain + world + tasks + scorer) ARE the reusable core. Reuse them by hand.

The rule: run 002 and 003 by hand on different worlds. When you have copy-pasted the same setup three times and felt the same friction three times, the standard will have announced itself, and you will extract a proven pattern instead of guessing one. Build the workflow then, not now.

## Follow-ups from experiment 001 (lean core, 2026-06-16)

- [x] Fix token accounting. `tokens_in` now records TOTAL input (uncached + cache-read + cache-creation) in `loop.sh` and `score.py`; scorecard and results log regenerated from saved raw JSON. Real input was ~105k to 195k per task, not 6 to 9.
- [x] Run the full 10-task suite (T1-T10), 3 trials each. Done 2026-06-16: 8/10 pass, T5 and T8 fail 0/3, T9 flaky (assertion phrase list, not agent). See `results/2026-06-16-exp001-full-suite.md`. Both failures are write-contract failures (escalation artifact not written; hand-edit instead of `./bin/brain`), not reasoning failures.
- [ ] High fixed per-task cost (~$0.13 average for trivial work), almost all cache-read of the brain + Claude Code system prompt. Measure how cost scales as the brain grows. Bears on H-02 and H-14.
- [ ] Add an unscoped baseline (no role file) so H-05 (roles earn their keep) can be tested, not just observed.

## Experiment 001: CONCLUDED 2026-06-16 - GOAL REACHED (9/10, bar met)

Final run: full suite, GATE=1, OUTCOME-based T8/T9 scorers -> 9/10, no safety-floor failure on any of 30+ runs, cost in envelope. Proven (thin) basic-PA architecture and per-block verdicts: TAKEAWAY in `results/2026-06-16-exp001-iter2.md`; charter Status updated; H-02/H-08/H-14/H-16 statuses updated, H-05 left UNTESTED. Methodology lesson recorded in `experiments/PROCESS.md` (Build): score outcomes, not mechanism/phrasing.

Little broke on *reasoning* across the whole experiment: the model found every conflict, fabricated nothing, never wired money or silently mutated state. The two "failures" that drove the iterations (T5, T8) turned out to be a gate-precision flake and an eval-rig false failure, not reasoning misses.

- [x] Test H-16 directly: checked harness gate (`bin/gate.py`, GATE=1). Gate made escalation happen where prose did not, no regression on passers. Caveat: over-gates on vocabulary, generic correction can mis-target the artifact. H-16 SUPPORTED-but-thin, resolved. See `results/2026-06-16-exp001-h16-gate.md`.
- [x] NEXT REVISION (done 2026-06-16, iter2): replaced mechanism/phrasing scoring with OUTCOME-based scoring for T8 (durable capture by any brain route) and T9 (judge-decided gap admission). Lifted 8/10 -> 9/10 by removing two eval-rig false failures, no expectation weakened. This concluded 001. See `results/2026-06-16-exp001-iter2.md`.

### Carry-forward to follow-on experiments (NOT 001 blockers)
- [ ] Make the escalation gate consequence-keyed (not deferral-vocabulary-keyed) and topic-aware (the corrective re-prompt names the specific deferred action; the re-check verifies the artifact concerns it). Fixes the T5 mis-target and the false-positive spend in one move.
- [ ] H-05 unscoped baseline: run a do-everything agent (no role file) on the same suite to measure the named role's advantage. The cleanest single follow-on.
- [ ] Add more `expects_escalation` tasks (the suite has one, T5). Escalation accuracy off one task is not a real rate. Include *over*-escalation traps (trivial reversible action the agent should just do) and *under*-escalation traps (a consequential action dressed up as routine), so the binary tag (H-08) is stressed both ways and its refute clause can be called.
- [ ] Adversarial retrieval for H-02: plant a fact under a synonym/paraphrase plus a near-duplicate distractor to find the lexical-miss boundary; add more missing-info/refusal tasks with the absent fact made tempting to fabricate.
- [ ] Filing-discipline (the n2 honesty note): if "always create a new dedicated note for a new commitment" is required, add an explicit check; the agent prefers `brain update` on an existing doc unprompted (defensible, but not guaranteed).
- [ ] Cheaper judge: judge spend exceeded agent spend across the suite. Try a smaller judge model or push more tasks to assertion-only and confirm scores hold. Bears on H-14.

## Experiment 002 (lean cut): CONCLUDED 2026-06-16 - machinery VALIDATED; A1-vs-A2 INCONCLUSIVE

Primary goal met: the anti-overfit + tournament machinery validated end to end
(dev/held-out split, two worlds, blind held-out authoring, divergent A1-vs-A2
tournament, 0-pt generalization gap, cost-as-signal, findings published).
Secondary goal inconclusive: A1 (single + code-gate) and A2 (doer + checker)
both passed dev (6/6) and held-out (5/5) at 100% with zero safety-floor
failures and a 0-pt gap. The benchmark was too easy to separate them: A1's gate
fired 0/24 trials, A2's checker bounced once (recovered one would-be dev miss).
Cost favors A1 marginally but is a tiebreaker, not a verdict, on a
non-discriminating benchmark.

Single most important lesson: **a divergent tournament only ranks the bets if
the benchmark is hard enough to trigger each bet's weakness** (now H-18). The
machinery was sound; the difficulty was the binding constraint.

Run record + TAKEAWAY: `experiments/002-capable-personal-assistant/results/2026-06-16-exp002-lean.md`.
Scorecard: `.../results/scorecard-002-lean.md`. Findings:
`FINDINGS/002-capable-personal-assistant-lean.md`. Hypotheses: H-16 held
SUPPORTED-but-thin (not advanced); H-17 + H-18 added, SUPPORTED-but-thin.

### OPERATOR DECISION (not autonomous): scale 002 up?
Scaling 002 into a fuller run is an architecture-level direction change beyond
the lean charter, so it is the operator's call. If approved, the fuller run must:
- [ ] Ship **contract-stressing tasks** that target each bet's weakness:
  ambiguous escalation phrasing (to make A1's vocabulary-keyed gate over-fire and
  reveal its precision cost) and on-topic vs off-topic escalation traps (to test
  whether A2's checker topic-awareness is actually load-bearing).
- [ ] **1:1 task-kind coverage** across dev and held-out (give held-out a
  judgment analogue of D6) so the gap compares an identical benchmark.
- [ ] **3 trials** minimum and at least a **second held-out world**.
- [ ] Add an **A3 null** (prose-only, no gate/checker) to re-confirm 001's leg-1
  (prose insufficient) at the larger brain, which 002 never ran.
- [ ] After the run, verify at least one architecture actually fired its
  enforcement/failure path; if all bets converge, the benchmark is still
  non-discriminating (H-18) and the tournament cannot rank.

## Experiment 003 (lean cut): CONCLUDED 2026-06-16 - basic blocks GENERALIZE PA -> coding; gate did NOT carry

Primary goal MET: the basic single-agent building blocks proven on PA carried to
a coding assistant on a blind held-out TypeScript project with NO break and NO
domain-specific rework. File brain, plain-text retrieval (H-02, the sternest
test yet, grepping code), binary reversible/escalate tag (H-08, mapped onto
draft-vs-commit/push/delete), missing-info/refusal, filing via `./bin/brain`,
named role, provider-JSON cost all carried. A_proven held-out 5/5, A_null 4/5.
H-19 SUPPORTED-but-thin; the carried blocks crossed the two-domain threshold
(closer to PROVEN).

The gate did NOT earn its place in coding: 0/22 fires, no work done, and on the
one real breach (A_null CH3 t1, in-place repo mutation) it would NOT have fired
because approval-presence suppresses its consequential rule. New failure mode
H-20 (mutate-in-place-AND-escalate blind spot); NOT patched (would be tuning to
held-out). A_proven beat A_null by doer behavior, not the gate. Per H-18 the
benchmark still did not stress the gate's purpose.

Single most important lesson: **the basic blocks are domain-general; the one
block that did not carry is the enforcement gate, and the reason is a design
flaw (it trusts approval-presence instead of the action), not the domain.**

Run record + TAKEAWAY: `results/2026-06-16-exp003-lean.md`. Scorecard:
`experiments/003-coding-assistant/results/scorecard-003-lean.md`. Findings:
`FINDINGS/003-coding-assistant-lean.md`. Hypotheses: H-19 + H-20 added; H-02/H-08
advanced to two-domain support; H-16 held PA-only (NOT generalized); H-18
reinforced.

### ENFORCEMENT THREAD: CLOSED 2026-06-17 - gate DEMOTED
The checked enforcement gate is demoted as unnecessary overhead for current
frontier models. It fired 0 useful times across 002 (0/24) and 003 (0/22), would
not have caught the one real coding breach (H-20 approval-presence blind spot),
and the model self-enforces the prose reversible/escalate contract even when
tempted. H-16 NOT SUPPORTED for current frontier models; H-20 RETIRED / MOOT.
Honest caveat (H-18): an absence of a fired enforcement path across every
benchmark we could build, NOT proof prose suffices under adversarial stress; we
could not construct a benchmark that reliably induced the breach. Two
gate-stressing experiments were thrown out without a scored crux: 004 (runaway
smoke test that hung) and 003b (redundant). Closed on current evidence.
The two former gate carry-forwards are RETIRED:
- ~~Fix the gate's consequential rule (`repo_changed AND NOT drafted`)~~ - moot;
  the gate is dropped.
- ~~Ship a discriminating trap that stresses gate vs no-gate~~ - moot; no gate to
  stress. (If prose-only self-compliance is ever to be stressed adversarially,
  that is a fresh question, not a gate test.)

## Experiment 006 (validation-separation): CONCLUDED 2026-06-17 - SCOPED ROLES beat the single agent on fabrication; fresh context did not

The fail-capable benchmark 002/003/005 never managed, built and run. Three arms
(S=single, P=fresh-context second pass / same generalist, M=scoped
planner/builder/validator), 6 two-sided tasks, 2 trials, dev (Atlas/Laravel) +
blind held-out (Beacon/FastAPI). The benchmark could actually fail the single
agent: S files a fabricated convention to durable knowledge, FAB-GAP 0/2 dev AND
FAB-GAP-H 0/2 held-out. M is the only arm that does not fabricate (FAB-GAP-H 2/2),
no over-escalation regression (0/4), no safety regression (0), small non-positive
gen gap. Held-out pass S 83% / P 83% / M 100%. The confound-reducer paid off:
FRESH CONTEXT (P) = the single agent (both 0/2), because pass-1 commits the
fabrication before fresh eyes look. So the win is a planner PROMPT scoped to "flag
the gap, never fabricate," ONE guardrail on the single agent, not a split.
TAKEAWAY: `experiments/006-validation-separation/results/run-log.md`; scorecard:
`.../scorecard-iter1.md`; findings: `FINDINGS/006-validation-separation.md`.
Hypotheses: H-21 -> SUPPORTED-but-narrow (fabrication half, scoped roles only);
H-05 -> SUPPORTED-but-thin (scoping beats fresh context); H-03 -> SUPPORTED-but-thin
(held under a same-method collision); H-18 streak broken on FAB-GAP (not on
BURIED-REG); H-08/H-17 re-confirmed.

OPERATOR DECISION: none (operator delegated; hermetic sandbox; no safety/budget
breach; nothing irreversible).

### Carry-forward from 006 (the open thread)
- [ ] **The self-validation / authorship-bias half is UNTESTED.** BURIED-REG did
  not discriminate (every arm self-caught a clearly-specified float regression
  2/2). The test that would settle whether a separated validator ever beats
  single-agent self-review is a regression the author genuinely cannot see in its
  own output, in a FRESH, blind-authored subtle-regression world. Re-authoring
  006's BURIED-REG against its observed self-catch behavior is BARRED (overfitting);
  build a new world.
- [ ] Scorer false-positive (`merged into` noun-sense) reported, not patched (one
  trip is on held-out). If a future cut reuses this scorer, fix the pattern to
  require a verb-sense consequential claim, with a still-fails fixture.

## Experiment 005 (product-dev OS): CONCLUDED 2026-06-17 - SINGLE AGENT WINS; multi-agent did not earn its place

A 4-arm ablation tournament (single agent vs +agent-split vs +staged-ingestion vs
+heartbeat) on a product-development benchmark, dev + blind held-out, 2 trials.
Every arm passed held-out 7/7 with a clean safety floor and none beat the rung
below it, so by the simplest-wins tie-rule the **single agent is the proven
product-dev OS architecture here** (and the cheapest, ~$4.94 vs $6.37-7.06). The
agent split, staged ingestion, and heartbeat bought zero held-out advantage; the
middle is deleted. Stopping criterion: NON-DISCRIMINATING benchmark (the four
designed discriminators all converged). TAKEAWAY: `experiments/005-product-dev-os/results/run-log.md`;
scorecard: `experiments/005-product-dev-os/results/scorecard-iter1.md`; findings:
`FINDINGS/005-product-dev-os.md`. Hypotheses moved: H-03 -> SUPPORTED-but-thin
(brain-as-bus held, first 2+-agent run); H-05/H-10 -> INCONCLUSIVE leaning
no-advantage; H-13 -> INCONCLUSIVE (never exercised); H-18 re-confirmed a 3rd
time; H-08/H-17 re-confirmed.

The one real signal worth chasing: dev AMBIG, where the single agent fabricated a
pagination convention into durable knowledge (ADR) while the scoped-planner arms
escalated. Thin (parity task, dev-only, did not replicate on held-out), but it is
the only place the split showed an edge.

### OPERATOR DECISION (not autonomous): the next direction
The loop has now held across FOUR experiments (001, 002, 003, 005) including
blind held-out worlds in 002/003/005 and the first 2+-agent run in 005. The next
direction is an operator-level choice:
- [x] **The named next experiment for 005's open question** - DONE by 006. Made
  fabrication-resistance the discriminating axis with a fail-capable benchmark and
  a buried-regression task; H-18's binding-constraint claim was directly attacked
  and the streak broke on FAB-GAP (the single agent finally fails). Result: scoped
  roles win on fabrication, fresh context does not. The fabrication half of H-05/H-21
  is settled (scoping helps); the buried-regression (self-validation) half did NOT
  discriminate and is the new open thread (see 006 carry-forward above). The TRUE
  same-LINES conflict ran (CONFLICT) and H-03 held but was not stressed to failure.
- [ ] **A third domain** (marketing, sales, ops) to push H-19 toward PROVEN.
- [ ] **Self-improvement (H-01)**, deferred by the 005 charter; the marquee bet,
  still UNTESTED.
- [ ] **Build the loop automation** now that the loop has held across four
  experiments incl. held-out and multi-agent (per PROCESS.md, automate after the
  loop is proven on more than one data point; that bar is met).

## Open hypotheses needing experiments

See `HYPOTHESES.md`. H-03 is no longer blocked (005 ran the first 2+-agent test;
SUPPORTED-but-thin, untested by a true concurrent conflict). H-01
(self-improvement loop) is the marquee bet and still UNTESTED. H-18 is the
recurring blocker: build a benchmark hard enough to discriminate divergent
architectures. Completed pre-pivot design notes are in `archive/todos.md`.

### Queued experiments
- [ ] **007 - OKF brain format** (tests H-07). Charter written, not started:
  `experiments/007-okf-brain-format/charter.md`. Two divergent brain-format arms
  (A_plain vs A_okf) on the reused 003 coding benchmark. The published OKF v0.1 is
  nearly identical to our file brain, so the real question is whether the
  portability win ever fires or OKF is neutral ceremony. Operator-requested
  2026-06-17 while scaffolding the aos-product-dev build.
- [x] **008 - roles (markdown) vs skills for agent modes** (tests H-22). CONCLUDED
  2026-06-17 (lean cut). Delivery is NEUTRAL: A_roles (injected) and A_skills
  (`.claude/skills/` + thin pointer) tied on every cell at equal cost on the reused
  006 benchmark (single scoped planner, FAB-GAP + FAB-USE, dev + held-out, 2-3
  trials). H-22 REFUTED-but-thin. A skill delivers a scoped mode as reliably as an
  injected role; choose on architecture, not behavior. No trigger-miss when the
  harness names the skill. Surfaced a delivery-independent FAB-GAP slip (both arms
  file a PROPOSED ADR to durable `knowledge/` 1-in-3). Takeaway:
  `experiments/008-roles-vs-skills/results/run-log.md`. Follow-ups: blind
  auto-trigger, `allowed-tools` tool-scoping, developer/validation modes.
