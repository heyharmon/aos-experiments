# Starter Kit

> The whole thing, smallest version: a durable brain and one role that works for you on a schedule — nothing cloud, nothing you can't read. Grab this if you want a single thing to build first. It's two modular recipes presented as one menu; once it runs, you grow it by adding more role recipes onto the same brain, never by rebuilding.

## Yields

A working **Stage 1** system (`AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md §12`): a git-backed brain you can query by hand, and a Personal Assistant that captures and triages what you hand it, keeps a prioritized task list, writes you a daily briefing, drafts outputs, escalates the consequential, and logs every run. The end-to-end "hello world" of the architecture.

## What you get

Everything lives in **one git repo**, nothing hidden, nothing cloud: the brain's three areas (`knowledge/` · `agents/` · `runtime/`) with the PA's charter under `knowledge/roles/`, its machinery under `agents/personal-assistant/`, and the `bin/brain` write contract. The full layout is in [`local-brain`](../brains/local-brain.md) (the brain) and [`personal-assistant`](../roles/personal-assistant.md) (the role's files and run loop); the kit just builds both into the same repo. Cron wakes `loop.sh`, the agent reads the charter and queue and writes back through `bin/brain`, and you drop tasks, read briefings, and approve actions. The agent holds nothing: kill it mid-run and the next wake reloads everything from the brain.

## Prerequisites

- **Runtimes:** `git`, `python3` + `pyyaml`, `ripgrep`, `bash`, `cron`/`launchd`.
- **Accounts:** a headless-authenticated Claude Code (`claude -p`).
- Nothing else — no cloud, no database, no accounts.

## Ingredients

This kit is a combination, not a new stack. It bundles:

| Part | Recipe | Reaches |
|---|---|---|
| The foundation | [`brains/local-brain`](../brains/local-brain.md) | Stage 0 |
| The first role | [`roles/personal-assistant`](../roles/personal-assistant.md) | Stage 1 |

## Steps

1. **Build the brain.** Follow [`local-brain`](../brains/local-brain.md) end to end. Stop when its *Doneness* checks pass — you now have Stage 0.
2. **Hire the role.** Follow [`personal-assistant`](../roles/personal-assistant.md), which runs on the brain from step 1. Stop when its *Doneness* checks pass — you now have Stage 1.
3. **Smoke-test end to end** (the kit's own check, below).

## Doneness

The combined test — both recipes' Doneness, plus the round trip that proves they work *together*:

- [ ] `brain queue add "draft a welcome note for new client Acme (urgent); note that Acme renewed for 12 months"` then trigger a heartbeat (or wait for cron).
- [ ] The next run: triages the task, files the durable fact by creating `knowledge/entities/acme/` via `bin/brain`, marks the task urgent, drafts the note to the brain, and appends a run record to `runtime/runs/`.
- [ ] The morning `brief` run writes `runtime/briefings/<today>.md` with the urgent Acme item at the top.
- [ ] `brain search Acme` finds the new entity.
- [ ] A consequential task lands in `runtime/queue/approvals/` instead of executing.
- [ ] `git log` reads as a clean, human-readable history of everything the system did.

## Pairs with

This is the base you build *onto*:

- **Add more role recipes** on the same brain to go from one role to a team (Stage 2) — Comms Manager, Scheduler, Product-Dev, etc. Each declares `requires: [local-brain]`, so it drops in with no change to the foundation. Scaling is hiring, not migrating (`§12`).
- **Add a dreaming recipe** (Stage 3) for nightly consolidation and the self-improvement loop (`§11`).

## Substitutions

Inherit the substitutions from both component recipes — swap the harness, the scheduler, the search layer, or raise the role's autonomy independently. Because the kit is just two modular recipes, you can replace either side without touching the other; that decoupling is the entire reason brain and role are separate recipes.
