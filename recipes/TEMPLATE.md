# {{Title}}

> One-paragraph pitch: what you'll cook and why you'd want it. Plain language.

## Yields

What you end up with, in a line or two — and which architecture stage it reaches.

## Prerequisites

- **Brain:** which brain recipe must already exist (role recipes & kits only).
- **Accounts / keys:** anything external.
- **Runtimes:** languages, CLIs, tools that must be installed.

## Ingredients

The prescriptive stack — the specific technology choices. This is what separates a
recipe from the architecture doc. Pick one of everything; alternatives go in
*Substitutions*, not here.

| Component | Choice | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| … | … | … |

## Steps

The ordered build plan. Concrete enough that a coding agent can execute it cold.

3. …

## Doneness

How you (or a verifying agent) know it works. Checkable, not vibes. These become the
first evals (`AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md §10`).

## Pairs with

Compatible recipes — brains this role runs on, roles that complement this one, kits
that include it.

## Substitutions

Swap-outs and earned upgrades. The base stays maximally simple; here's how to grow it
when the work demands it — and the signal that tells you it's time.
